GOALS

Improve statistical, data science, and programming skills, especially for
  Python
Communicate my skills by maintaining a GitHub site illustrating a data analysis
  project

Some Specifics
    Learn to make dashboards
    Learn to do deep learning


THOUGHTS

5/8/2020 -> What do I want to do?
  Calculate growth rates
  Calculate doubling time
  Calculate, plot, model, etc. in both Python and R -> start with R as I'm
    more fluent in it, but goal is to improve Python skills, especially in
    modeling
  Model - methods tbd
  Create dashboards -> R Shiny and Python Dash
5/8/2020 -> How to calculate growth rates on a percentage basis

5/8/2002 -> How to calculate a doubling time

ACTIONS

5/8/2020 3pm -> Checked that joining and pivoting data did not create inaccuracies
  in the data, by comparing the # of cases and deaths per day after the join and
  pivoting procedures from the Greene County, Ohio data with the cases Changed
  deaths in the original "wide" datasets.  No errors were found.

  Modified "cgriffith_covid_19.R" plotting function so that both cases and
  deaths were displayed on the same plot, added a legend and a second y-axis,
  and made it easier for a user to change the x and y variables.

5/8/2020 -> Modified "cgriffith_covid_19.R" to download the US death data as well
Joined the cases and death datasets using dplyr. Changed selected Ohio county
from Franklin to Greene as the much smaller case load in Greene will make
checking easier.

5/7/2020 -> Created R script "cgriffith_covid_19.R" that loaded US case data, changed the data from
wide to long format, created separate datasets for Ohio and Franklin county
Plotted Franklin county cases

5/6/2020 -> Cloned John Hopkins covid-19 database
